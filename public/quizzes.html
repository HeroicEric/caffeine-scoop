      <blockquote>
        Back in May 2008, Spanish researchers reported that hot, dehydrated cyclists who downed caffeine with their water and carbs could pedal harder for a longer time in steamy weather—the first study to specifically simulate summertime temperatures. The scientists think caffeine stimulates muscles, thereby helping to offset heat-related fatigue.

        Glycogen, the muscle's primary fuel source during exercise, is replenished more quickly when athletes ingest both carbohydrate and caffeine following high-intensity workouts. Cyclists who drank large amounts of caffeine (five to six strong coffee cups worth!) along with carbs had 66% more glycogen in their muscles four hours after biking until exhausted, compared to when they consumed carbohydrate alone.

        While once deemed true, we now know that coffee is not dehydrating. The truth is, a moderate intake of coffee, cola, and other caffeinated beverages do count toward fluid needs, particularly if you are accustomed to consuming caffeine as part of your daily diet.
