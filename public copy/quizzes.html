    <p>Why do scientists think that caffeine can help to offset heat-related fatigue?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Caffeine helps the cyclists to stay alert.</li>
      <li>The extra water from what they're drinking helps the cyclists to stay hydrated.</li>
      <li class="correct">Caffeine helps to stimulate muscles.</li>

      <blockquote>
        Back in May 2008, Spanish researchers reported that hot, dehydrated cyclists who downed caffeine with their water and carbs could pedal harder for a longer time in steamy weatherâ€”the first study to specifically simulate summertime temperatures. The scientists think caffeine stimulates muscles, thereby helping to offset heat-related fatigue.

    <p>Glycogen, the muscle's primary fuel source during excercise, is replenished more quickly when athletes ingest both caffeine and _________ following high-intensity workouts.</p>

      <blockquote>
        Glycogen, the muscle's primary fuel source during exercise, is replenished more quickly when athletes ingest both carbohydrate and caffeine following high-intensity workouts. Cyclists who drank large amounts of caffeine (five to six strong coffee cups worth!) along with carbs had 66% more glycogen in their muscles four hours after biking until exhausted, compared to when they consumed carbohydrate alone.

    <p>Drinking coffee causes dehydration.</p>

      <blockquote>
        While once deemed true, we now know that coffee is not dehydrating. The truth is, a moderate intake of coffee, cola, and other caffeinated beverages do count toward fluid needs, particularly if you are accustomed to consuming caffeine as part of your daily diet.
